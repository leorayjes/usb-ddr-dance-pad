# DIY DDR/StepMania Pad

## Parts List:
- 4&#39;x8&#39; sheet of ¾&quot; MDF
- 2&#39;x4&#39; sheet of ½&quot; MDF
- 2&#39;x4&#39; sheet of ¼&quot; plywood
- 2&#39;x4&#39; sheet of 1/8&quot; plywood
- 4&#39;x8&#39; sheet of 4.5mm (.17&quot;) Polycarbonate
  - Acrylic is a much cheaper alternative
- 33&#39; Roll of copper tape
  - Aluminum foil is a much cheaper alternative
- Arduino Leonardo
  - Any brand is fine, I used a keyestudio Leonardo R3 Development Board
- 100&#39; of 20-gauge AWT wire
- 34&quot;x34&quot; Vinyl printed
  - Cuts into 9 11&quot;x11&quot;s
  - Ledger size paper prints are a much cheaper alternative
- 32 ½&quot; #8 screws
  - Screw diameter is somewhat arbitrary, just make sure it holds the material
- 40 ¾&quot; #8 screws
  - Screw diameter is somewhat arbitrary, just make sure it holds the material
- 1&#39; of ¼&quot; PET Expandable Braided Sleeving
- USB Extension Cable (Type A Male to Female)
- Foam Rubber Insulation
  - I used ½&quot;
- Black semigloss paint
- Spray Adhesive
- Wood glue

## Measurements:
- Panel Base
  - 34&quot;x34&quot;
    - Need 1
  - MDF
- Individual Panels
  - 11&quot;x11&quot;
    - Need 9 of each material
  - MDF
  - Polycarbonate
- Panel Perimeter
  - 1&quot;x34&quot; – Miter cuts
    - Need 4
  - 1&quot;x34&quot; and 1&quot;x32&quot; – Box fit (flat)
    - Need 2 of each
  - MDF
- Panel Risers
  - 9&quot;x9&quot;
    - Need 4 of each material
  - Hardboard
  - Plywood
- Circuits
  - 9&quot;x9&quot; flat square
    - Need 4 for button contact
  - For riser panel circuitry, follow [8x8\_contact\_panel.pdf](https://github.com/leorayjes/usb-ddr-dance-pad/blob/master/8x8_contact_panel.pdf)
  - Copper Tape _or_ paper-backed aluminum foil
- Arrow graphics
  - 34&quot;x34&quot; – if printing all at once
    - Need 1
    - May be cheaper to print all arrows into one piece of Vinyl
    - Use the RGB\_arrows\_print\_v4.eps file in the [Google Drive link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Ho9Ss0-xzzeFMXIAYueZQqeo9CPXzv1s/view?usp=sharing)
    - This will give you enough for 2 pads
  - 11&quot;x11&quot; – if printing individual arrows
    - Need 4
    - [Use blue\_arrow\_single.pdf](https://github.com/leorayjes/usb-ddr-dance-pad/blob/master/blue_arrow_single.pdf)
    - [Use red\_arrow\_single\_no\_border.pdf](https://github.com/leorayjes/usb-ddr-dance-pad/blob/master/red_arrow_single_no_border.pdf)
  - Vinyl _or_ paper

## Tools Used:
- Table Saw
- Scissors
- Wire strippers
- Screwdriver
  - If you use a power-drill for screws, be careful not to ruin the MDF
- Power-drill
- Drill press
  - You don&#39;t have to sink your screws, it just looks a little nicer and saves your toes.
- Clamps
  - You will need N +1 where N is the number that you currently have
- Aircompressor and bradnailer
  - This isn't completely necessary, I just wanted to assemble faster than the glue would dry

## Notes:
- The Arduino code was written by Alex from Super Make Something
- The Graphics are pulled from HackMyCab
  - Shout out to author and designer u/psisarah
- Any material can be used to build the pad, MDF is not necessary.
  - MDF
    - Pros
      - Flat
      - Consistent
    - Cons
      - Heavy
      - Messy
    - WEAR A MASK. The particulates from this are intense; you don&#39;t want to breathe this stuff.
- Adhesive backed Vinyl (_not_ static cling) is very difficult to place (for me) and you only have 1 shot. Failure to place an arrow correctly will result in you having to recut a piece of Poly as most anything that will remove adhesive with dissolve/craze the surface of poly
- I used polycarbonate because I was afraid of cracking acrylic due to the nature of dancing games and my clumsy stomping. That being said, acrylic would likely work just fine.
- I would recommend recessing your arrows slightly (i.e.: make the button panel thinner than the base panels around it)
- I would recommend playing with shoes due to the edges of the Polycarbonate as well as the screws
- The project is still lacking a 3D printed enclosure for the Leonardo.

## Retrospective:
- If I did it again, I would go with melamine panel or simply plywood instead of MDF for the sake of my lungs and weight. The heft of this material is no joke.
- ½&quot; sleeving would be an easier fit (as opposed to ¼&quot;)
- Stranded wire is better than solid
- The height of the step panels (buttons) was somewhat of a guess game so I would be more meticulous in future builds.
- I should have used an edge finisher or at least sanded the edges of the Polycarbonate as it is quite sharp
